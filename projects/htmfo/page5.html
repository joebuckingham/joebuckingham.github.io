Text around these illustrations reads: I was 16 when I got a smartphone, and I was never really 'offline' again. Almost immediately I fell into an intense SMS-based flirtation with someone from school - I think as much as I was infatuated with them, I was just as intoxicated by the fact it never had to stop because I was being booted from the computer. It was early summer and I sweltered under my duvet so my parents wouldn't see the light from my phone screen."/>
