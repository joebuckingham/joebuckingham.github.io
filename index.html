          <h2>Sex Education | Otis Milburn's Condom Tutorial</h2>
          <p>A video edit to promote Netflix’s Sex Education - this was a really fun chance to play with precise coming timing, as well as adding animation that added to, but didn’t distract from, the overall piece.</p>
          <p>Edited in Premiere Pro with keying, compositing and animation done in After Effects.</p>

          <h2>Trinkets | You Wouldn't Steal A...</h2>
          <p>A parody of the classic “You wouldn’t steal a car” pre-roll, to promote Netflix’s Trinkets, which tells the story of three teenage shoplifters. This didn’t make it into the final campaign due to a change in overall direction, but it was too much fun to work on not to include.</p>
          <p>Edited in Premiere Pro with titles, animation and colouring in After Effects.</p>

          <h2>Netflix UK | International Women's Day 2019</h2>
          <p>A short-turnaround video for Netflix UK to celebrate International Women’s Day. Designed to be inspiring and moving but without relying on the tired “strong female character” trope - because there’s more to well-written female characters than just “strength”.</p>

          <h2>A Series of Unfortunate Events | Instagram Grid</h2>
          <p>A beast of an Instagram grid to launch the Instagram account for A Series of Unfortunate Events. Fans of the show love to dig into content with lots of hidden details, clues and Easter eggs, so we created an evidence wall, comping together photography of the show’s props. Behind the board, using Instagram’s carousel feature, we hid an even richer second layer of video, photography, and designed content (a few static examples below). While it’s been broken up by later posts now, the second layer content is still worth a look at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unfortunate/" target="blank">@unfortunate</a> (at the very bottom of the account).</p>

          <h2>A Series of Unfortunate Events | Misfortune Machine</h2>
          <p>Working with an experiential agency to re-skin a real-life Zoltar machine to promote A Series of Unfortunate Events. I designed and artworked the vinyl wrap for the machine itself, as well as creating the tickets that it printed. I also then concepted, shot and created promotional content for the event, including promotional videos and an interactive version of the machine for social.</p>

            <h2>Netflix UK | Natasha Lyonne</h2>
            <p>A silly video edit for Netflix UK - not so much an example of technical skill as an example of an edit where I was about to bring extra humour out of a piece through timing and creative subtitling.</p>
